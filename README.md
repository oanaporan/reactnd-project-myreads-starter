# MyReads Project

The goal of this project was to create a React App that has a main page with three shelves with books. Each book is shown on the correct shelf, along with its title and author(s), and can be moved to different shelves or removed by the user. The app has also a search page which uses API calls to search new books and add them to the shelves on the main page. 

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md).

## Installing and launching the project

* Dowload the project file 
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
